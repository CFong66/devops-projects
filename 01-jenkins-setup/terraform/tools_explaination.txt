Target Groups

What they are: Logical groups of targets (EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses) that receive traffic from a load balancer.
Role:
They determine where to send the traffic.
They track the health of your targets, ensuring traffic only goes to healthy instances.
Features:
Protocol and Port: You specify what kind of traffic they handle (e.g., HTTP port 80, HTTPS port 443).
Health Checks: Regularly verify target health.
Types of Targets: Can include EC2 instances, containers, or even IP addresses.
Listeners

What they are: Configurations on your load balancer that "listen" for incoming traffic.
Role:
Define how traffic first enters the load balancer.
Specify the protocol and port for a connection (e.g., HTTPS on port 443).
Can perform basic routing decisions based on URL patterns (for Application Load Balancers).
Actions: Listeners determine what to do with the traffic:
Forward to Target Group: The most common action, sending traffic to a specified target group.
Redirect: Send traffic to a different location.
Other Actions: Authenticate users, etc. (with Application Load Balancers).
How They Work Together

Incoming Traffic: A client request arrives at your load balancer.
Listener's Turn: The load balancer has listeners configured for various protocols/ports. It finds the listener matching the request.
Rule Evaluation: The listener may have routing rules to choose a target group.
Target Group's Decision: The target group selects a healthy target from its pool.
Response: The load balancer forwards the request to the chosen target, and the target processes the request and sends a response.
Analogy

Think of it like a mail sorting facility:

Target Groups: Bins for different neighborhoods.
Listener: The incoming mail truck arriving with a new batch.
Listener Rules: Instructions deciding which bin the mail goes to based on the address.
